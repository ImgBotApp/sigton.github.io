				<h1>Olly - My Dog</h1>
				<div class="widecontent">By Sigton, 17/12/16</div><br />
				<div class="widecontent">I have a dog. He's a lovely dog. His name is Olly. And he is so adorable! Olly is just over a year old, and we got him last Christmas.
				He is a golden retriever, though he hasn't really got the hang of retrieving things yet. He'll run after the ball, pick it up, start running back, then drop it half way.
				Maybe one day he'll learn, who knows.</div><br />
				<div class="content"><img src="../resources/dog.jpg"></div>
				<div class="content">Olly has a great nature. He never growls (apart fromn at the neighbours cat), and always wants to play with other dogs, it doesn't matter if they dont want to play with him.
				He's really well trained, too. For example, if it's getting late but he still wants to play, you can just say 'bedtime', and off he hops into his bed, lies down and goes to sleep.
				Who's a good boy :P</div>
